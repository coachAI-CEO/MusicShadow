# Music Shadow — Privacy Policy

**Last updated:** January 2025

Music Shadow ("we," "our," or "the app") is committed to protecting your privacy. This policy explains how we handle your data.

---

## Introduction

Your privacy is fundamental to Music Shadow. We do not sell your data. You own what you create, and you can delete it at any time. This document describes what data we collect, how we use it, and your rights.

---

## Data We Collect

We store the data you create in the app:

- **Logged activations** — song title, artist, body location, impulse, intensity, journal entries (guided and free-form), and timestamps
- **AI-generated reflections** — wound type, protector mode, core belief, and other insights generated when you request a reflection
- **Account information** — used for sign-in and account management (e.g., email if you sign in with a provider)
- **Partner sharing preferences** — whether and how you share specific activations with a linked partner (optional feature)

We do not sell your data to third parties.

## How We Use Your Data

Your data is used to:

- Provide the app (e.g., show your history, patterns, and insights)
- Generate AI reflections when you request them
- Support optional partner sharing when you enable it
- Improve the service (e.g., fixing bugs, improving performance)

We do not use your data for advertising or sell it to advertisers.

---

## Data Ownership

- You own all data you create in Music Shadow.
- Your entries, reflections, and patterns belong to you.
- Data is stored securely using industry-standard encryption.
- You can export or delete your data at any time from within the app.

---

## Sharing Rules

- **All entries are private by default.**
- Sharing with a partner is completely optional.
- You choose which triggers to share using the "Share with partner" toggle.
- You control what level of detail your partner sees (Minimal or Full).
- You can unshare any trigger at any time.
- Unlinking a partner immediately stops all sharing.

---

## Deletion Rights

- You can delete any logged activation at any time.
- Deleting a trigger also removes its associated AI reflection.
- Deleting your account removes all your data permanently.
- There is no recovery period — deletion is immediate and final.
- Shared data is removed from partner views when you delete it.

---

## Service Providers

We use the following to operate the app:

- **Supabase** — secure cloud database and authentication. Data is stored in Supabase; authentication uses industry-standard OAuth and JWT tokens.
- **Google Gemini API** — AI processing for reflection generation. Only the content necessary to generate a reflection is sent; we do not share your data with AI providers for their own use or training beyond that purpose.

All API calls are encrypted in transit. We do not share your data with third parties for marketing or advertising.

## Changes to This Policy

We may update this privacy policy from time to time. We will post the revised version at this URL and update the "Last updated" date. Continued use of the app after changes constitutes acceptance of the updated policy.

*Your data is never sold. You can delete any entry at any time. Sharing is explicit and reversible.*
